# TelegramParser
This is my first experience of creating a Git project and sharing my code as well. Also this is the first programm that is doing something more than calculate two integers.
Use it with UserBot, that creates with Telegram API.
This programm is working with console interface.
Programm can iterate your dialogs, find groups, and then it parses members (only for groups, not for channels and not for supergroups with more than 5000 members) and sends them the one of the three messages (you can change list of messages by yourself however you want).
Use it carefully, because you can get banned your Telegram account for Flood and Spam.
